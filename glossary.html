<p>A concept tries to capture the idea behind a classification of entities<a href="#note1">^1</a>, allowing us to reason about everything in the class as if it were one thing. For example, the ideas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_representation">mental representations</a>) you have when processing the sentences &quot;I can drink beer from a beer glass' and 'I can drink beer from a coffee mug' shows that the concepts that are behind 'beer glass' and 'coffee mug' differ. Note that in order to communicate about this idea, we also need a word or phrase (i.e., a term) that we can use to refer to (instances of) this idea.</p>

<p>The purpose of having a corpus is that it allows for the development of tools that support authors and groups of people to better communicate, by enabling them to refer to the definition of a term whenever that term is used. This is particularly beneficial when a specific term can be interpreted in different ways (according to different definitions). </p>
<p>Tools that we envisage will query for terms from the corpus, and use that e.g. to create a custom <a href="#glossary" title="An alphabetically sorted list of terms with short explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some scope.">glossary</a> document, a terminology appendix in a paper you write, or as a resource from which you generate pop-up balloons in a website you create.</p>

<dd><p>A <strong>Definition</strong> is a text that helps <a href="#party">parties</a> to have the same understanding about the meaning of a <a href="#term" title="A word or phrase that is used in a scope in a specific meaning, typically referring to a specific concept.">term</a>, and hence enables communications. The quality of a definition is the extent in which parties can use it to actually demonstrate that they have the same understanding.</p>
<p>The problem that definitions (as we see them) contribute to solving is misunderstandings that may arise as every <a href="#party">party</a> has its own <a href="#knowledge">knowledge</a> and autonomously determines the <a href="#semantics" title="We use the term semantics to refer to the mapping between (tangible) terms and (intangible) concepts (their meaning, the ideas behind it).">semantics</a> it uses to express itself in texts/speech/pictures, and interpret that of other parties. The fact that the semantics of parties is subjective makes it realistic to assume that the meaning that a party intends to convey as it expresses itself is not the same as how another party interprets that expression - a 'misunderstanding'.</p>
<p>All parties have learned, with varying degrees of sophistication, to identify misunderstandings, and ways to recover from that.</p>
<p>A common mechanism for reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings to occur, is to associate terms with texts that are crafted to help parties have the same understanding, i.e. definitions. This mechanism is sometimes overrated in the sense that definitions are often considered to be universally valid rather than only useful in specific <a href="#terminology" title="The set of terms that are needed within a scope for communicating and reasoning.">scopes</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, we insist that such texts</p>
<ul>
<li>are associated with a <a href="#scope" title="A common context -- consisting of a community of interest or community of practice, plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds a cohesive set of concepts and their associated terms.">scope</a> within which they are considered to be valid/useful (for the <a href="#objective">objectives</a> that <a href="#party">parties</a> pursue in that <a href="#scope" title="A common context -- consisting of a community of interest or community of practice, plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds a cohesive set of concepts and their associated terms.">scope</a>);</li>
<li>are phrased as a <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/criterion">criterion</a> that every such <a href="#party">party</a> can evaluate so as to determine whether or not something qualifies to be refered to by that term.
The quality of such texts is the extent in which parties reach the same conclusion as they evaluate the criterion in an arbitrary use-case that is relevant for the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#pattern-terminology">terminology pattern</a> provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
The eSSIF-Lab <a href="#terminology-process">terminology process</a> provides guidance for making and maintaining quality definitions.</p>

<p>A Dictionary is an alphabetically sorted list of <a href="#term" title="A word or phrase that is used in a scope in a specific meaning, typically referring to a specific concept.">terms</a>, each of which has at least one explanation.

<p>Scopes are also used to define the content of a glossary; most glossaries consist of all terms in one scope. (Glossaries may import or reference terms from other scopes, but since such terms will be managed by a different community, they have different versioning and release formalities.)</p>

Semantics are scoped, i.e. every <a href="#scope" title="A common context -- consisting of a community of interest or community of practice, plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds a cohesive set of concepts and their associated terms.">scope</a> has its own semantic mapping. This implies that every <a href="#party">party</a> has - and maintains - its own (subjective) semantics, which is its subjective mapping of a set of terms onto the concepts/ideas in its <a href="#knowledge">knowledge</a>. The (erroneous) assumption that <a href="#party">parties</a> would (automagically) share a semantics is the cause of many misunderstandings, and hence should be identified and deleted as soon as possible.</p>

<dd><p>A set of <a href="#party">parties</a> who choose to collaborate to realize a specific set of <a href="#objective">objectives</a>, and realize that in order to realize them, they need a cohesive set of <a href="#term" title="A word or phrase that is used in a scope in a specific meaning, typically referring to a specific concept.">terms</a> (a <a href="#terminology" title="The set of terms that are needed within a scope for communicating and reasoning.">terminology</a>) that each of these parties can rely on to be interpreted in the same way by all members of that community, and which they operationalize by <a href="#curate" title="To evolve concept and term data in the direction of greater quality and richer content within a specific scope.">creating and maintaining</a> this terminology. They do so by:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing a set of <a href="#term" title="A word or phrase that is used in a scope in a specific meaning, typically referring to a specific concept.">terms</a> that is specific to them, and help to realize their <a href="#objective">objectives</a>. They can do this by creating and maintaining a <a href="#terms-wiki" title="A wiki that is dedicated to the formal management of terms that are specific for (some purposes within) a scope and that conforms to conventions defined by ToIP Foundation's Concepts and Terminology Working Group.">terms wiki</a>, and develop a <a href="#curate" title="To evolve concept and term data in the direction of greater quality and richer content within a specific scope.">curation</a> process for managing (changes in) the definitions of such terms.</li>

</ul>
<p>From this, they can create and (automatically) publish a <a href="#glossary" title="An alphabetically sorted list of terms with short explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some scope.">glossary</a> that contains all such terms (i.e. both defined by themselves as by others), which will be the authoritative register for terminology within the <a href="#scope" title="A common context -- consisting of a community of interest or community of practice, plus its associated knowledge domain, processes, and shared purpose -- that surrounds a cohesive set of concepts and their associated terms.">scope</a> of realizing the <a href="#objective">objectives</a> for this community.</p>
